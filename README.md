# RevMixer by Team RevMixer
RevMixer provides a platform for musicians to create, upload, and share music with the public. A common issue with modern streaming platforms is that they allow for music distribution, but are not at all involved in the creation aspect of the music. RevMixer aims to remedy this problem by allowing artists to quickly design, record, and publish their songs, all on one platform.
